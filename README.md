# Java.-Sem-1.-Assignment-1

Java. Sem 1. Assignment 1

Task 1.
Create Java library (not-executable jar). 
Add needed dependencies to the project. Java classes of the library will be dependant on some classes of another external library. For example, if we want to use tuples in java (class Pair) we have to include artifact org.javatuples:javatuples
Compile the lib
Install the lib into local repository.

Task 2. 
Develop an application using the library implemented in Task 1.
Build the application and install it in the local repository.
Run application using IntelliJ
Run application using terminal (command line)


Taks 1 and Task 2 should be implemented using both maven and gradle.
